👋 Hello! I’m Rafael Ayala — a licensed Architect based in New York with 10+ years of experience in architectural design, BIM, computational design, 3D modeling, construction documentation, and administration.

💻 I specialize in software engineering with expertise in Python, Java, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL — building innovative tools that transform how we design, build, and interact with the built environment.

🏗️ I’ve been involved in developing and deploying digital twin platforms that connect real-world building data with digital models, helping improve building operations, asset management, and lifecycle performance.

🚀 I’m passionate about bridging architecture and technology, crafting solutions that bring clarity, efficiency, and intelligence to complex projects.
